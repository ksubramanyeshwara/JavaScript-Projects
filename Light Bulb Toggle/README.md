# Challenge 1: Light Bulb ToggleðŸ’¡

- Create a webpage featuring a light bulb image or representation.
- Implement a button that toggles the light bulb between on and off states.
- When the bulb is on, it should appear in yellow or gold (or any other suitable color) with a glow effect.
- When the bulb is off, it should appear gray with no glow.
- The button text should dynamically update based on the bulbâ€™s state (e.g., "Turn On" / "Turn Off").
- Apply a dark mode effect to the page when the bulb is off.
